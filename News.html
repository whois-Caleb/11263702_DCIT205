         <h3> University of Ghana Students in Shock as Lecturer Assigns Homework Requiring Actual Effort</h3>

        <p>In a shocking turn of events, students at the University of Ghana, Legon, specifically the Computer Science Department, found themselves in a state of panic and disbelief as one lecturer dared to assign an assignment that actually demands work.</p>
        <p>Professor Michael Taskmaster, known for his seemingly outrageous expectations, assigned a project that goes beyond the usual cut-and-paste methodology the students have grown accustomed to. The assignment, rumored to require critical thinking, research, and creativity, has left students scrambling to find the elusive "Easy A" loophole.</p>
        <p>"I can't believe he's doing this to us. This is supposed to be my chill semester!" complained Tim Procrastinator, a level 200 student majoring in Information Technology. "I thought university was all about partying and sleeping through lectures. Now I actually have to open a textbook?!"</p>
        <p>The assignment, which requires students to design and create a website for the Computer Science Department, has sparked outrage on campus. Students have taken to social media, creating memes and hashtags like #BringBackEasyAssignments and #SaveOurGPA, in a desperate attempt to cope with the reality of academic effort.</p>
        <p>"I joined this university because they said it's a prestigious institution. But now they're making me do stuff? It's an outrage!" exclaimed Emily OpenAI-Expert, another level 200 student majoring in Computer Science.</p>
        <p>Even the university's counseling services reported a spike in emergency appointments as students grapple with the terrifying prospect of having to produce original thoughts. Campus therapists have reportedly run out of soothing phrases like "It'll be okay" and "You're not alone" as students confront the harsh reality of academic responsibility.</p>
        <p>Professor Taskmaster defended the assignment, stating, "I believe in challenging students to think critically and apply their knowledge. This assignment is designed to prepare them for the real world where people might expect them to do actual work. Shocking, I know."</p>
        <p>As the deadline for the assignment approaches, the university is bracing for an unprecedented wave of last-minute cramming and existential crises. Students are considering forming a petition demanding a return to the good old days of effortless grades and minimal intellectual stimulation.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, campus authorities are advising students to stock up on energy drinks, motivational posters, and emergency supplies of instant noodles as they embark on this harrowing journey of academic engagement. The fate of the Computer Science students' GPAs hangs in the balance as they grudgingly face the horrifying prospect of having to put in some effort.</p>
